- 75-word bio: Bhima Raj Bhattarai makes music that refuses boundaries. Drawing on years of writing, singing, and producing for himself, he has forged a sound where punk-inspired grit collides with electronic pulse and heartfelt lyricism. His songs can be defiant or tender, meditative or explosive — always carrying the urgency of someone who fought to stand in the light. Bhattarai’s vocals move easily from intimate croons to anthemic shouts, while his production thrives on the tension between raw edges and immersive atmospheres. More than anything, his work is proof of life.
