        <h2>About Bhima</h2>
        <span>For Bhima Raj Bhattarai, music has always been more than a pastime — it’s survival, release, and a declaration of presence. From an early age he found himself drawn to songs that carried weight: the grit of punk bands, the catharsis of emo anthems, the sweep of pop hooks, the hypnotic pulse of electronic beats. Without a band to lean on, he turned to computers and his own voice, teaching himself to build tracks from scratch. That DIY instinct remains at the heart of his work.</span>
        <span>What emerges is a sound that thrives on contrast. One song might surge with distorted, guitar-like synths and pounding beats, while the next hovers on a mantra-like vocal over shimmering atmospherics. Bhattarai’s style resists easy labels — it’s at once melodic and abrasive, heartfelt and rebellious, spiritual and modern. His lyrics draw from lived struggle, often touching on resilience, identity, and finding hope amidst noise.</span>
        <span>As a performer, he brings the same duality. He can deliver a line with the intimacy of a whisper or roar through a chorus with the conviction of protest. In the studio, he leans into experimentation, unafraid to collide sounds that don’t “belong” together until they spark something new.</span>
        <span>Listeners often describe leaving his music with a sense of uplift — not because the songs sugarcoat, but because they carry truth. There’s catharsis in the grit and clarity in the calm. With his debut album on the horizon, Bhattarai steps forward not to fit into a genre box but to prove what he’s known all along: he is alive, unbroken, and capable of turning his journey into sound worth hearing.</span>
